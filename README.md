# Sales-Performance-and-Operations-Dashboard

# Overview
This project demonstrates how Power BI dashboards can be used to analyse sales performance, customer ordering behaviour, and operational patterns for a food business.

Using Power BI and DAX, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights:

- Revenue drivers

- Peak ordering times

- Best-performing products and categories

- Opportunities to optimise staffing, promotions, and menu strategy

The dashboard is designed for business owners and operations managers to support day-to-day and strategic decisions.

# Business Problem

Food and QSR businesses often struggle with:

- Staffing inefficiencies during peak and off-peak hours

- Limited visibility into best-selling items and categories

- Missed revenue opportunities during low-demand periods

- Difficulty translating raw order data into operational actions

Key questions addressed:

- When do customers place the most orders?

- Which products drive the highest revenue and volume?

- Which days and times require higher staffing levels?

- What is the average value of an order?

# Solution Approach

I built a sales and operations-focused Power BI dashboard that converts transactional data into clear insights.

**🔹 Core Performance Metrics**

- Total Revenue

- Total Orders

- Total Quantity Sold

- Average Order Value (AOV)

**🔹 Time-Based Sales Analysis**

- Orders by hour of day

- Orders by time-of-day segments (morning, afternoon, evening, night)

- Orders by day of week

**🔹 Product & Category Performance**

- Top-selling pizzas by quantity

- Top revenue-generating pizzas

- Sales contribution by pizza category

**🔹 Data Modeling & DAX**

- Created DAX measures for revenue, AOV, and order counts

- Built calculated columns for time-of-day and weekday analysis

- Established clean relationships across orders, products, and categories

# Key Business Insights & Impact

- Total revenue of ~$818K from ~21K orders
 → Strong baseline sales performance

- Orders peak during afternoons and evenings, especially around lunchtime
 → Staffing and kitchen capacity should scale during these hours

- Friday is the highest-order day
 → Ideal for promotions, bundles, and upselling

- Classic category dominates sales
 → Core category to protect, promote, and expand

- The Classic Deluxe Pizza leads by volume, while Thai Chicken Pizza leads by revenue
 → Clear candidates for featured menu placement

- Average Order Value is ~$38
 → Opportunity to increase AOV via combos and add-ons

# Strategic Recommendations

- Increase staffing during afternoon and evening peak hours, especially Fridays

- Launch targeted promotions during low-demand periods (early mornings, late nights)

- Highlight top-performing pizzas in menus and marketing campaigns

- Bundle popular pizzas with sides or drinks to lift AOV

- Use time-based insights to improve operational efficiency

# Tools & Technologies

- Power BI

- DAX

- Power Query (data cleaning & transformation)

# Why this Matters for Your Business

This dashboard shows how data can:

- Improve operational planning

- Increase revenue through better timing and product focus

- Support smarter staffing and promotion decisions

- Provide managers with real-time visibility into performance

The same approach applies to:

- Restaurants

- QSR chains

- Food delivery partners

- Multi-location food businesses

# 📌 Note

This project uses a publicly available pizza sales dataset for demonstration purposes.

The dashboard structure and insights are directly applicable to real restaurant data.
